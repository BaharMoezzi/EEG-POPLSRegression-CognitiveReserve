# Introduction
Parallel and orthogonalized partial least squares (PO-PLS) multiblock regression was used in order to investigate associations between a comprehensive cognitive reserve proxy and functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex across the whole scalp, covarying for the level of current cognitive functioning.

This repository provides the code for our investigation of the associations between EEG functional brain connectivity and a cognitive reserve proxy in healthy older adults
